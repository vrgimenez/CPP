# CPP Terminal Interface (TUI) Examples

A set of examples of Terminal User Interfaces (TUI) written in C++.

## Introduction

The goal is to place characters in the console window to create a User Interface.  
Here the approach utilizes the Multiplatform [PDCurses](https://github.com/wmcbrine/PDCurses) library, designed for non-Unix
environments, including DOS, OS/2, Windows console, X11, and SDL.  
Also, I included the same set of examples as in `NCurses` folder.
